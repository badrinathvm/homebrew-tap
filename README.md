    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Contributing to this Tap

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/new-formula`
3. **Add your formula** to the `Formula/` directory
4. **Test your formula**: `brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/your-formula.rb`
5. **Submit a pull request**

### Creating a New Release

When updating the Swift Version MCP server:

1. **Create and push a new tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Calculate SHA256 hash**:
   ```bash
   curl -L "https://github.com/badrinathvm/SwiftVersionMCP/archive/v1.2.0.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256
   ```

3. **Update the formula** with new version and SHA256

4. **Test the updated formula**:
   ```bash
   brew uninstall swift-version-mcp
   brew install swift-version-mcp
   ```

### Formula Structure

Our formulas follow standard Homebrew conventions:

```ruby
class SwiftVersionMcp < Formula
  desc "Swift version MCP server"
  homepage "https://github.com/badrinathvm/SwiftVersionMCP"
  url "https://github.com/badrinathvm/SwiftVersionMCP/archive/v1.2.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "your-calculated-sha256-hash"

  depends_on "swift"

  def install
    system "swift", "build", "--configuration", "release", "--disable-sandbox"
    bin.install ".build/release/swift-version-mcp"
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/swift-version-mcp", "--help"
  end
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found after installation**:
```bash
# Check if Homebrew's bin is in your PATH
echo $PATH | grep -o '/opt/homebrew/bin'

# If not, add to your shell profile
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Permission issues during build**:
```bash
# Ensure you have proper Xcode/Swift setup
xcode-select --install
swift --version
```

**MCP client can't find the server**:
- Verify the executable path: `which swift-version-mcp`
- Check your `mcp.json` configuration
- Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
